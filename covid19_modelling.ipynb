    "# Modelling COVID-19 community spread\n",
    "\n",
    "This model for the spread of COVID-19 would actually apply in general to any homogenous population in a closed infection environment where transmission is internal within that population (i.e. no source of infection from arrival of external travellers). The growth rate is modelled as a proportion of the population who are contagious, which is less than the population who are infected since some infected people are still within the incubation period.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is not statistical in the sense of modelling random sampling and random events in the population. All such details are approximated by continuous differential equations as functions of time. Constant values are used for incubation time, detection time, duration of illness and death rate. In the practical example, such parameters are tuned to the Australian context where necessary, and otherwise reckoned from broad variety of sources (not yet well referenced).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the growth rate model, I include a scaling factor on the growth rate parameter that tapers the growth as the number of resolve cases approaches a certain population threshold. In the early growth phase, this scaling factor is essentially 1, so the model behaves like exponential growth. As the proportion of resolved cases becomes a significant proportion of the population, the growth rate will taper until the total number of infections (active + resolved) levels off at the assumed herd immunity level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically speaking, we end up with a system of differential equations where derivatives of some variables depend on other variables at negative time delays. It is this feature that I believe is important in capturing the dynamics of the growth of the infection. The philosophy applied here is to model the true number of infections over time (even though in practice this is not known) and from that, derive observable quantities such as the known number of active infections over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The growth rate parameter $\\alpha$ is a key input and is not derived from any first principles. Instead, this parameter is tuned to fit known data to date, and then either held constant or computed dynamically according to some assumed policy or behavioural model to try to forecast the resulting model variables. For example, if social distancing was imposed on a particular date, then $\\alpha$ could be reduced from that date onwards. Or $\\alpha$ could be made to depend on the number of known cases, modelling reaction of government to the daily situation. However the actual values of $\\alpha$ to use in such cases should be modelled on, or fitted to, actual data, so have limited predictive purpose. It is reasonable, however, to fit $\\alpha$ to known date up to now, then run the model forwards to project the outcomes of the growth rate remaining constant."

    "The growth rate $G$ in simple exponential growth represents the rate of change in $N$ per unit time from new infections and is proportional to $N$ itself, i.e. it must look something like $\\frac{dN}{dt} = \\alpha N$. However this needs to be modified to account for two effects. Firstly, the growth rate is not proportional to $N$ at the present instant, rather proportional to the infected who are contagious, which is $N(t - t_i)$. Secondly, the growth rate needs to be tempered as the number of infected or previously infected approaches the herd immunity level. The modified growth rate is thereby formulated as\n",
